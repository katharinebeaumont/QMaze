<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>This is a maze, 'the environment', that the agent will learn to make it's way through. 
There is one goal, in a room. 
Once the agent gets to the room, it will stop. 
In order to learn the best route to the room, the agent will try to find it by using a mix of exploration, and (if it has been in the room before) memory.</p>
<h4>Configuring the maze</h4>
<p>To open or close a room, hold down 'control' and click on the room.</p>
<p>To change the starting position, or goal, click on the room and select the option. 
You can't make the starting position and the goal the same place!</p>
<p>You might want to change the number of rows or columns, which you can do using the 'rows' and 'columns' selectors.</p>
<h4>Training parameters</h4>
<p>When we train the algorithm, we get a 'Q' value for each state and action. We take as many steps as it takes to get to the goal, and once we reach the goal, the 'episode' is complete. 
Training occurs over many episodes.</p>
<p>If for step t, we move from room A to room B, we'd get a Q(A(t),B(t)).</p>
<p>If we move back from room B to room A, we'd get a Q(B(t),A(t)).</p>
<p>You can describe it as: Q(current state at this step, action I'll take from this step / next state).</p>
<p>The equation is:</p>
<p>Q(S(t), A(t)) &larr; Q(S(t), A(t)) + &alpha; [ R(t+1) + [&gamma; * max Q(S(t+1), a) ] &minus; Q(S(t), A(t)) ] </p>
<p>So each time we make a step, we add the  current Q value for the (state,action) pair (or 0 if there is none)  to: </p>
<p>&emsp; learning rate &alpha; </p>
<p>&emsp; &emsp; * [  any reward I saw for moving into the next room </p>
<p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; + reward discount &gamma; * (what is the highest value I can get for moving on from the next room?) </p>
<p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  - the current Q value for the state,action pair ] </p>
<p>The 'Q' value is the memory.</p>
<p>Aside from the state of the maze, the following will impact the agent training.</p>
<p>'Probability Explore' is the probability that, at each training step, the agent will pick a random action. So 0.1 means there is 10% chance the agent will randomly pick a room - regardless of it's memory. The other 90% of the time, it will search it's memory to see - do I remember what happened last time I was in this room? Which is the best way forward? If there is no memory, then it defaults to randomly picking.</p>
<p>'Reward Discount' is the 'gamma', &gamma;, value in the Q learning equation. When building up the Q table, for each room we look at the best next action - the next room with the highest value. We add this to the current room's value, but we multiply it by thereward discount first (as well as the learning rate, and a few other things). This means that the closer to the goal state, the higher the value of the actions. </p>
<p>'Learning Rate' controls how much we increase the Q value each time: this is the 'alpha', &alpha;,value in the Q learning equation.</p>
<h4>Once trained...</h4>
<p>Pick a heat map colour to give you an idea of how much each room was visited. Darker colours mean that room was visited more.See how changing the 'Probability Explore' affects this.</p>
<p>Press 'Show optimal path' to show the agent moving through the maze, in the way that it reaches the goal with the most reward.</p>
